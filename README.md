# Time-Table
This project involved developing a user-friendly web application to help faculty members access their daily schedules and view class timetables quickly, featuring intuitive interfaces for smooth navigation. It aimed to streamline schedule management, enhancing the efficiency of timetable retrieval and overall productivity for faculty members. My role encompassed end-to-end development, managing both frontend and backend aspects. I developed frontend components using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for intuitive user interfaces and implemented backend functionalities using Node.js to handle server-side logic efficiently, while also designing and managing the MySQL database for secure data storage and retrieval.
